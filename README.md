# Codecademy- Tea Cozy Project

This Repo is for a Codecademy project to create a website from a pre-defined design spec/image of the website. I added some additional features, such as mail and number links as well as making the site a bit more responsive to smaller veiwports. Another change was with the heading levels. I kept the heading levels in the descedning order instead of skipping the heading levels for the sake of styling.
